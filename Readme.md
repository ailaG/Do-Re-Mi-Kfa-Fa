Musical glove, made in the Hack2Wear hackathon in 2014.

Somewhat customizable.

Demo of the hackathon version: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy7-hqw3_GU

TODO: Sketch, instructions (physical), instructions (customizing), better video, better readme (oh, snap!).

Lessons learned:
* Disconnect the speaker when testing
* Piezos need padding underneath them for this
* Piezos and their soldering are delicate creatures

Bugs (TODO: use bugtracker instead)
- Piezo goes low when pressed, then high when released, then slowly goes low again. Can't tell the difference between a finger that hasn't been pressed in a while and a finger that's being pressed right now.
- Need to disable "distance pin" better.
